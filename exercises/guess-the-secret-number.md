Guess the secret number
======================

Write a program that randomizes a number and lets you guess which number it is.

The process will go something like this:

 1. Randomize a number (TODO: How? Hints?)
 2. Ask the user to guess the number
 3. Print "Correct!" and exit if the number is correct, otherwise print "lower" or "higher" depending on if the guess is too high or too low. Then go back to step 2.

## Extra

Write a program that finds the number in a minimum amount of steps using binary search.
