Want to draw pretty & cool things using a programmable turtle with a paint problem? Then this is the exercise for you!

# Getting started

Start by opening the repl.it environment for [*Turtle in Python*](https://repl.it/languages/python_turtle)

Here is a simple example that walks the turtle in a square:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.color("red")

for c in range(4):
    t.forward(75)
    t.left(90)
```

Run it and see what happens, can you figure out what happens? Try modifying some values and see how the behavior changes.
