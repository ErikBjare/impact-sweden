Impact Sweden
=============

A project for teaching programming and computer science in primary and secondary education.

We have received a 15,000â‚¬ grant from [Google CS4HS](https://www.cs4hs.com/) to start the project and will begin by trying it out on secondary schools in southern Sweden. The project will initially focus on introducing programming as a tool in mathematics courses, which is the direction that programming is likely to go in Swedens secondary education system.

 - All material will be open source.
 - We will try our hardest to make the content engaging and interesting for students.
 - We accept contributions.
