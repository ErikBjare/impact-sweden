Involve Sweden
==============

A project for teaching programming and computer science in primary and secondary education.

We have received a 15,000€ grant from [Google CS4HS](https://www.cs4hs.com/) to start the project and will begin by trying it out on secondary schools in southern Sweden. The project will initially focus on introducing programming as a tool in mathematics courses, which is the direction that programming is likely to go in Swedens secondary education system.

 - All material will be open source.
 - We will try our hardest to make the content engaging and interesting for students.
 - We accept contributions.

## Getting started

To get started as fast as possible, we suggest you use the online [Python 3 environment at repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3).

We still have more work to do before this is usable as a part of a curriculum. But in the meantime, you can check out the cheatsheet and the exercises.

## Hosting it locally

In case you want to help develop the material you might want to run the website locally to preview your changes before committing and pushing. **If this doesn't work for you, create an issue or contact the maintainers so we can find and eliminate the bugs.**

First make sure you have `ruby` and `bundle` installed.

Then install the necessary ruby packages:

```sh
make install-deps
```

Then start the development server with:

```sh
make serve
```


## Problems

 - How do you make programming exercises for a mathematics course?
 - Which language should we write the material in?
   - Swedish:
     - (+) We will use it on Swedish students, who probably want it in Swedish.
     - (-) Real programs are never written in Swedish.
     - (-) The course material will have limited reuse outside of Sweden.
   - English:
     - (+) The English terminology is a de-facto standard that you need to know as a programmer.
     - (+) All the help resources available online is in English.
