Impact Sweden
=============

A project for teaching programming and computer science in primary and secondary education.

We have received a 15,000â‚¬ grant from [Google CS4HS](https://www.cs4hs.com/) to start the project and will begin by trying it out on secondary schools in southern Sweden. The project will initially focus on introducing programming as a tool in mathematics courses, which is the direction that programming is likely to go in Swedens secondary education system.

 - All material will be open source.
 - We will try our hardest to make the content engaging and interesting for students.
 - We accept contributions.


## Problems

 - How do you make programming exercises for a mathematics course?
 - Which language should we write the material in?
   - Swedish:
     - (+) We will use it on Swedish students, who probably want it in Swedish.
     - (-) Real programs are never written in Swedish.
     - (-) The course material will have limited reuse outside of Sweden.
   - English:
     - (+) The English terminology is a de-facto standard that you need to know as a programmer.
     - (+) All the help resources available online is in English.
